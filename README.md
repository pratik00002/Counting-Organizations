# Counting-Organizations
The "Counting Organizations" project is a Python application designed to read mailbox data from a file (mbox.txt), count the number of email messages per organization (i.e., domain name of the email address), and store the counts in a SQLite database. The application then retrieves and displays the top organizations with the highest email counts.
